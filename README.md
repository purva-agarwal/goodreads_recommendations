## Data Pipeline Architecture & Components

This section provides a detailed breakdown of the data pipeline components and their functionality within the Apache Airflow DAG.

### Pipeline Overview

The `goodreads_recommendation_pipeline` DAG orchestrates a comprehensive data processing workflow that transforms raw Goodreads data into a machine learning-ready dataset. The pipeline follows MLOps best practices with data validation, cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization stages.

### Pipeline Components (DAG Tasks)

#### 1. **Data Reading & Validation**

- **Task ID:** `read_data_from_bigquery`
- **Type:** `BigQueryInsertJobOperator`

- **Validation Logic:**
  - **Books Table (Source):**
    - **Critical Field Validation:** Ensures `book_id` and `title` are never null
    - **Business Rule:** These are essential identifiers that cannot be missing
    - **Zero Tolerance:** Any null values cause validation failure
  - **Interactions Table (Source):**
    - **Referential Integrity:** Ensures both `user_id` and `book_id` are present
    - **Relationship Validation:** These are foreign keys that must exist
    - **Zero Tolerance:** Missing identifiers would break user-book relationships

#### 4. **Data Cleaning**

  - Maintains data consistency across different feature types

### Pipeline Flow & Dependencies

```text
start → read_data_from_bigquery → log_bq_results → validate_data_quality 
    → clean_data → validate_cleaned_data → feature_engg_data → normalize_data → end
```

### Error Handling & Monitoring

- **Retry Logic:** Configurable retry attempts with exponential backoff
- **Logging:** Comprehensive logging at each stage for debugging and monitoring
- **Data Quality Gates:** Pipeline stops if critical data quality issues are detected
- **BigQuery Integration:** Seamless integration with Google Cloud Platform for scalable data processing

### Data Quality Validation Framework

The pipeline implements a comprehensive data quality validation system using BigQuery SQL queries that operates at two critical stages: **pre-cleaning** and **post-cleaning**. This ensures data integrity throughout the entire processing workflow.

#### **Validation Architecture**

The validation system uses the `AnomalyDetection` class with the following key components:

- **BigQuery Integration:** Direct SQL query execution for scalable validation
- **Progressive Validation:** Different validation rules for source vs. cleaned data
- **Zero Tolerance Policy:** All validations use `max_allowed: 0` - any violations stop the pipeline
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Detailed validation results logged for monitoring
- **Email Alerts:** Automatic failure notifications sent to stakeholders

#### **Pre-Cleaning Validation (Source Data)**

**Purpose:** Validates raw data before any processing to ensure basic data integrity.

**Books Table Validation:**

```sql
-- Critical field validation
SELECT COUNT(*) as null_count
FROM `project.books.goodreads_books_mystery_thriller_crime`
WHERE book_id IS NULL OR title IS NULL
```

**Interactions Table Validation:**

```sql
-- Referential integrity validation
SELECT COUNT(*) as null_count
FROM `project.books.goodreads_interactions_mystery_thriller_crime`
WHERE user_id IS NULL OR book_id IS NULL
```

**Validation Logic:**

- **Critical Field Validation:** Ensures `book_id` and `title` are never null
- **Referential Integrity:** Ensures both `user_id` and `book_id` are present
- **Business Rule:** These are essential identifiers that cannot be missing
- **Zero Tolerance:** Any null values cause validation failure

#### **Post-Cleaning Validation (Cleaned Data)**

**Purpose:** Validates cleaned data to ensure business rules and ML readiness requirements are met.

**Books Table Validation:**

```sql
-- Data integrity and range validation
SELECT COUNT(*) as invalid_count
FROM `project.books.goodreads_books_cleaned_staging`
WHERE title IS NULL 
   OR publication_year IS NULL 
   OR publication_year < 1000 
   OR publication_year > 2030
   OR num_pages IS NULL 
   OR num_pages <= 0 
   OR num_pages > 10000
```

**Interactions Table Validation:**

```sql
-- Data integrity and rating validation
SELECT COUNT(*) as invalid_count
FROM `project.books.goodreads_interactions_cleaned_staging`
WHERE user_id IS NULL 
   OR book_id IS NULL 
   OR rating < 0 
   OR rating > 5
```

**Validation Logic:**

- **Data Integrity:** Ensures cleaning process didn't introduce new nulls
- **Range Validation:** Validates `publication_year` is reasonable (1000-2030)
- **Business Rules:** `num_pages` must be positive and realistic (≤10,000 pages)
- **Rating Validation:** Validates ratings are within expected range (0-5)
- **ML Readiness:** Ensures data is suitable for recommendation algorithms

#### **Key Design Principles**

1. **Progressive Validation:** Pre-cleaning focuses on critical fields, post-cleaning adds business rule validation
2. **Zero Tolerance:** All validations use `max_allowed: 0` - any violations stop the pipeline
3. **Business Logic:** Range checks ensure data makes business sense
4. **ML Pipeline Readiness:** Post-cleaning validation ensures data is suitable for machine learning
5. **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Detailed logging and email notifications for failures

#### **Pipeline Integration**

The validation system integrates with the Airflow DAG at two critical points:

1. **Pre-cleaning** (`validate_data_quality` task): Validates source data before any processing
2. **Post-cleaning** (`validate_cleaned_data` task): Validates cleaned data before feature engineering

This ensures data quality gates at both ends of the cleaning process, preventing bad data from propagating through the ML pipeline and ensuring the final dataset meets the requirements for recommendation system training.

### Bias Analysis & Fairness Assessment (`bias_analysis.ipynb`)

**Purpose:** Comprehensive bias detection and mitigation analysis using group-level shrinkage to ensure fair recommendations across multiple dimensions.

**Analysis Dimensions:**

1. **Popularity Bias** - High/Medium/Low popularity groups (based on book_popularity_normalized)
2. **Book Length Bias** - Categories based on book_length_category
3. **Book Era Bias** - Publication era groups (book_era)
4. **User Activity Bias** - High/Medium/Low activity user groups (based on user_activity_count)
5. **Reading Pace Bias** - Fast/Medium/Slow reader categories (reading_pace_category)
6. **Author Gender Bias** - Male/Female author groups (using gender_guesser library)

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Data Source:** BigQuery table `goodreads_features_cleaned` with 10,000+ records
- **Mitigation Method:** Group-level shrinkage with λ = 0.5 to pull extreme group means toward global mean
- **Metrics Analyzed:**

  - Percentage read per group (behavioral metric, unchanged)
- **Fairness Calculation:** Equity index based on variance reduction and mean change penalties

**Analysis Process:**

- **Before Analysis:** Calculated group means for each dimension
- **Mitigation Applied:** Adjusted ratings using formula: `rating_debiased = original_rating - λ * (group_mean - global_mean)`
- **After Analysis:** Recalculated group means post-mitigation
- **Fairness Metrics:** Computed variance ratios, relative mean changes, and equity indices

**Key Findings:**

- **Bias Detection:** Systematic rating disparities identified across all analyzed dimensions
- **Mitigation Effectiveness:** Group mean shrinkage successfully reduced extreme group differences
